# DATA-205-Capstone
This project was developed as part of my Capstone Experience for the completion of my Associateâ€™s Degree in Data Science. It analyzes and visualizes reported crime trends in Montgomery County using publicly available crime data from DataMontgomery, covering the years 2016 to 2025. As part of my final product, it includes five-year predictions of reported crime rates and an interactive Shiny dashboard that compiles key visualizations, allowing users to explore various aspects of my research.

This repository includes:
- The code for my final project (interactive Shiny dashboard is seen once the code is run in RStudio)
- My final report
- My final presentation
